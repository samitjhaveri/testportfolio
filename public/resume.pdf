This is a placeholder for the resume PDF file.

In a real implementation, this would be a PDF file containing:

- Contact Information
- Professional Summary
- Work Experience
- Education
- Skills
- Projects
- Certifications

To add a real PDF:
1. Create or export your resume as a PDF
2. Save it as "resume.pdf" in the public folder
3. The download link in the navigation will work automatically

For now, this text file serves as a placeholder to demonstrate the download functionality.
